== MyMockr

MyMocker is contains a koan built with Cucumber and some customised formatting that
goes about stepping you through the process of creating a mocking class.

At the moment, the mocking class can only mock no-argument methods.

At certain stages through the koan, you get prompted to run the usage features,
which actually use the class that you have built in "real world" (contrived..?)
situations.

=== The aim of the game
The goal is to show a simple use of the method_missing paradigm in Ruby, and
demonstrate the difference between mocks and stubs.

A bonus goal is to do it in the smallest amount of code possible.
